# Django Learning Lab

A long-term learning lab for mastering Django from fundamentals to production-level architecture.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository is a **personal Django learning lab**.

I use this project as a structured environment to deeply understand how Django works internally —  
from basic request/response flow to ORM behavior, database design, authentication, APIs, and deployment.

Rather than focusing on a single finished product, this repository records the **learning process itself**:
experiments, validations, refactors, and gradual design improvements.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build a **solid mental model** of Django
- Understand *why* Django works the way it does, not just *how*
- Learn the boundary between:

  - Application logic and database responsibility
- Prepare for **real-world Django development and architecture**
